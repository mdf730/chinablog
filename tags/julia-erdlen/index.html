    <p>Our final day in China!</p>

<p>We started the day with an adventure to the Wide and Narrow Alleys, where we did a ton of shopping and acquired a ridiculous amount of souvenirs.  We were joined by Sichuan University students as our guides, and without them we wouldn&rsquo;t have made it to lunch!</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we headed over to   Pingâ€™an Qiao Church, where we played for their 4 pm mass in English, attended by international students and residents.  After that, we played a concert for members of their church, specifically some of the candidates for RCIA and their youth ministry groups.  We all were given rosaries by the priest there as a thank you.</p>

<p>At the end of the long day, we packed up our bells and supplies for travel, because we fly out early tomorrow morning!</p>

    <p>Today we saw pandas!</p>

<p>Giant and red pandas both were at the breeding center in Chengdu. We took a massive amount of pictures and had the chance to see pandas under a year old. A few of us sent postcards with pandas on them to family members to commemorate this fun morning.</p>

<p>The afternoon consisted of setup for our second and final concert at Sichuan University. It was an amazing show with solos from Sichuan students and Joe Tang on piano. It was great to have the same program as last night after such a busy week!
The Vice President for Internationalization was also in attendance, and awarded us all certificates for performing.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is our last full day in China, with a mass, concert, and some exploring on the agenda.</p>

    <p>We began our adventure tour of Sichuan University, even seeing a gigantic bell on their campus!</p>

<p>We then took a speeding tour through part of their museum, focusing on Chinese folk art. We saw clothing from traditional wedding ceremonies, carvings and beautiful paper, and shadow puppets made out of leather.</p>

<p>We then met with the Vice President for Internationalization for Sichuan University, to discuss our mural goals of international collaboration.</p>

<p>After that, we headed over to the other Sichuan campus for a full rehearsal of the concert for the sound and lighting organizers.  We had digital backdrops that displayed a bit of Notre Dame to our listeners here!</p>

<p>The concert was wonderful! We played for a crowded room of university students, and felt a little like rock stars with our setup and lights.  It was great, and we have a chance to do it again at our concert tomorrow night!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Today was the perfect blend of sightseeing, performances, and faith.</p>

<p>We started our day adventuring to Tian&rsquo;anmen Square and the Forbidden City.  We saw ancient buildings, got a history lesson, and took some amazing pictures.</p>

<p>Next we headed to a Catholic Church in Beijing, the South Cathedral. It serves 10,000 parishioners!  We learned about the history of the Catholic Church in China, and that it began over 400 years ago in the place we were standing. Then, we celebrated mass in the chapel.</p>

<p>We then had the opportunity to join with choirs from the North and South Cathedrals for a concert in the evening. We heard some wonderful pieces from those liturgical choirs, and they even dedicated one of their pieces to us!</p>

<p>Our Chinese students introduced all of the bell pieces, and even taught our audience a bit about handbell ringing!  We had the chance to play some of our favorite liturgical pieces tonight, for an audience that really appreciated that element and mission of our work in the choir!</p>

<p>Tomorrow we will perform for school children and then leave Beijing to head to Chengdu for the second leg of our adventure!</p>

    <p>We climbed the Great Wall of China!</p>

<p>We spent the full day, our day &ldquo;off&rdquo; from ringing a formal concert, on the Great Wall of China. It was an amazing, once in a lifetime experience (for most of us).  We climbed many, many stairs up to stand on the actual wall.</p>

<p>And then we got to ring bells there. We packed them in backpacks surrounded by sweatshirts and socks, and all bells (and people) arrived safely when we got to the top. We played the Alma Mater atop the Great Wall of China. It was the most surreal moment of the trip.</p>

<p>All of our feet were aching, and we were utterly exhausted by the time we got to the bottom of the wall. But we still took the time to pick up some souvenirs. Some of us really enjoyed haggling with vendors for a good price, and helped the rest of us get a good deal on our pictures, pins, and hats. A few of us tried some street food, in the form of veggie crepes!</p>

<p>Next: The Forbidden City, Tian&rsquo;anmen Square, and the South Cathedral!</p>
